I'm Duncan Mwanik. I design stuff. Stuff that might need electronics/hardware, embedded programming, Machine Learning, Python Apps and Cloud services like AWS Sagemaker.
I was a Mechatronics student. That was before they started teaching me stuff I didn't want to know. I took a break, and together with my skills, I fight crime! Haha..

I have tonnes of ideas running through my mind, just like you. Right now, I'm working to build a Kenyan Smart Home products company that makes smart homes a standard, not a luxury. It's also gonna help other product designers intergrate both offline and online speech recognition into their works, and make them smart too. You can check that out at tellmyhome.co.ke
