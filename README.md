Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I fancy myself as a maker of all sorts, of all nice and of all possible ðŸ˜„.
 
Let's talk about:
1. PCB Design using KiCAD or EasyEda.
2. Firmware Development using C, C++, Python or Arduino.
3. Microcontrollers: ESPs, Atmels, STMs and more.
4. Communication using BLE, MQTT, LoraWAN, GSM, I2C, UART and many more.
5. Cross-platform app development using FLutter.
6. Rapid prototyping.

Here's my ideal flow of work:
1. Brainstorming the idea.
2. Identifying the technologies to be used.
3. Drawing flowcharts for the hardware and software sytems to be used.
4. Creating hardware prototypes.
4. Creating software prototypes.
5. Testing hardware and software.
6. Debugging hardware and software.
7. Debugging some more...
8. Some even more debugging...
9. Well, now we have an optimally(or acceptably) working product, let's go to production.
