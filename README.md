Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I fancy myself a maker of all sorts, of all nice and of all possible ðŸ˜„.
 
Let's talk about:
1. PCB Design using KiCAD or EasyEda.
2. Firmware Development using C, C++, Python or Arduino.
3. Microcontrollers: ESPs, Atmels, STMs and more.
4. Communication using BLE, MQTT, LoraWAN, GSM, I2C, UART and many more.
5. OTA updates using various providers.
6. Cross-platform app development using FLutter.
7. Rapid prototyping.
